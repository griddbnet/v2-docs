# Introduction									 

## Purpose of this documentation

This manual is targeted at designers and developers who perform system design and development using GridDB Community Edition.

The contents of this manual are as follows.

  - Structure of GridDB
      - Describes the cluster operating structure in GridDB.
  - The data model of GridDB
      - Describes the data model of GridDB.
  - Functions provided by GridDB
      - Describes the data management functions provided by GridDB.
  - Parameter
      - Describes the parameters to control the operations in GridDB.

#### :warning: Note
- GridDB is a database that manages a group of data (known as a row) that is made up of a key and multiple values. Besides having a composition of an in-memory database that arranges all the data in the memory, it can also adopt a hybrid composition combining the use of a disk (including SSD as well) and a memory. 
- OS user (gsadm) is created when GridDB is installed using the package.

| number of nodes constituting a cluster              | Refers to the number of nodes constituting a GridDB cluster. When starting GridDB for the first time, the number is used as a threshold value for the cluster to be valid. (Cluster service is started when the number of nodes constituting a cluster joins the cluster.)                                                                                                                   |

Multiple container data are arranged in a block. Block size is set up in a definition file (cluster definition file) before the initial startup of GridDB.                                                              |

Partition groups are created according to the number of concurrency (/dataStore/concurrency) in the node definition file.                                                                        |

| Container (Table)                                   | Container to manage a set of rows. It may be called a container when operated with NoSQL I/F, and may be called a table when operated with NewSQL I/F. What these names refer are the same object, only in different names. A container has two data types: collection and timeseries container.                                                                                             |

Transaction log file is updated every time the GridDB database is updated or a transaction occurs, whereas the checkpoint file is written at a specified time interval.                                                                                         |

| LSN (Log Sequence Number)                           | Shows the update log sequence number, which is assigned to each partition during the update in a transaction. The master node of a cluster configuration maintains the maximum number of LSN (MAXLSN) of all the partitions maintained by each node.                                                                                                                                         |
| Replica                                             | Replication is the process of creating an exact copy of the original data. In this case, one or more replica are created and stored on multiple nodes, which results to the creation of partition across the nodes. There are 2 forms of replica, master and backup. The former one refers to the original or master data, whereas the latter one is used in case of failure as a reference. |
| Owner node                                          | A node that can update a container in a partition. A node that records the container serving as a master among the replicated containers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| user definition file                                | File in which an administrator user is registered. During initial installation, 2 administrators, system and admin, are registered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Cluster database                                    | General term for all databases that can be accessed in a GridDB cluster system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Database                                            | Theoretical data management unit created in a cluster database. A public database is created in a cluster database by default. Data separation can be realized for each user by creating a new database and giving a general user the right to use it.                                                                                                                                       |
| Failover                                            | When a failure occurs in a cluster currently in operation, the structure allows the backup node to automatically take over the function and continue with the processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Client failover                                     | When a failure occurs in a cluster currently in operation, the structure allows the backup node to be automatically re-connected to continue with the processing as a retry process when a failure occurs in the API on the client side.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Table partitioning                                  | Function to access a huge table quickly by allowing concurrent execution by processors of multiple nodes, and the memory of multiple nodes to be used effectively by distributing the placement of a large amount of table data with multiple data registrations in multiple nodes.                                                                                                          |
| Data partition                                      | General name of data storage divided by table partitioning. Multiple data partitions are created for a table by table partitioning. Data partitions are distributed to the nodes like normal containers. The number of data partitions and the range of data stored in each data partition are depending on the type of table partitioning (hash, interval or interval-hash).                |
| Data Affinity                                       | A function to raise the memory hit rate by placing highly correlated data in a container in the same block and localizing data access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Placement of container/table based on node affinity | A function to reduce the network load during data access by placing highly correlated containers in the same node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
